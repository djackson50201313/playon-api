Playon API

I've been a long time user of the Playon Media Server, and love it's functionality. 
However it can be frustrating to have to either walk to the PC to add something to record, or to remote into the system, to be able to use the windows program.
I know there are upnp and xml interfaces that are published and I've used them in the past to automate some of this(like back when DirectTv was a provided channel amd you could record live TV).
With the advent of LLMs, and work I do in my day job I wondered if I could make this even easier to search. 
I've gotten some functionality created, and will be adding functionality as I go, potentially even function as an MCP server.
